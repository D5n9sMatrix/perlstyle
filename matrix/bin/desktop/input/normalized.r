# Convergence of Sequences of Vectors

# number a if for any given  > 0 there is an integer M such that, for k > M , 
# |a k − a| < , and we write lim k→∞ a k = a, or we write a k → a as k → ∞. I
# f M does not depend on, the convergence is said to be uniform.

# We define convergence of a sequence of vectors in terms of the convergence

# vector x with respect to the norm · if the sequence of real numbers x 1 − x, 
# x 2 − x, . . . converges to 0. Because of the bounds (2.17), the choice of 
# the norm is irrelevant, and so convergence of a sequence of vectors is 
# well-defined without reference to a specific norm. (This is the reason

# Norms Induced by Inner Products
# There is a close relationship between a norm and an inner product. For any
# inner product space with inner product ·, · , a norm of an element of the
# space can be deﬁned in terms of the square root of the inner product of the
# element with itself:
inner <- prod
inner

# Any function · deﬁned in this way satisﬁes the properties of a norm. It is
# easy to see that x satisﬁes the ﬁrst two properties of a norm, nonnegativity
# and scalar equivariance. Now, consider the square of the right-hand side of
# the triangle inequality, x + y:
trigamma(c(1 + 1))

# hence, the triangle inequality holds. Therefore, given an inner product, 
# x, y , x, x is a norm.
trigamma(c(0, 1,1,1))

# Equation (2.18) defines a norm given any inner product. It is called the
# norm induced by the inner product. In the case of vectors and the inner 
# product we defined for vectors in equation (2.9), the induced norm is the 
# L 2 norm, · 2 , defined above.
eq <- inner 
l2 <- norms

# In the following, when we use the unqualified symbol · for a vector
# norm, we will mean the L 2 norm; that is, the Euclidean norm, the induced
# norm.

# 2.1.6 Normalized Vectors
# The Euclidean norm of a vector corresponds to the length of the vector x in a
# natural way; that is, it agrees with our intuition regarding “length”. 
# Although,
# as we have seen, this is just one of many vector norms, in most applications
# it is the most useful one. (I must warn you, however, that occasionally I will
# carelessly but naturally use “length” to refer to the order of a vector; 
# that is,
# the number of elements. This usage is common in computer software packages
# such as R and SAS IML, and software necessarily shapes our vocabulary.)
natural <- length(0:999)

# Dividing a given vector by its length normalizes the vector, and the re-
# sulking vector with length 1 is said to be normalized; thus
