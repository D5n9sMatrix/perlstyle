# Cones
# A set of vectors that contains all positive scalar multiples of any vector in
# the set is called a cone. A cone always contains the zero vector. A set of
# vectors V is a convex cone if, for all v 1 , v 2 ∈ V and all a, b ≥ 0, 
# av 1 + bv 2 ∈ V .
# (Such a cone is called a homogeneous convex cone by some authors. Also,
# some authors require that a + b = 1 in the dentition.) A convex cone is not
# necessarily a vector space because v 1 − v 2 may not be in V . An important
# convex cone in an n-dimensional vector space is the positive orthant together
# with the zero vector. This convex cone is not closed, in the sense that it
# does not contain some limits. The closure of the positive orthant (that is, 
# the nonnegative orthant) is also a convex cone.

# 2.1.3 Basis Sets
# If each vector in the vector space V can be expressed as a linear combination
# of the vectors in some set G, then G is said to be a generating set or 
# spanning
# set of V. If, in addition, all linear combinations of the elements of G are 
# in
# V, the vector space is the space generated by G and is denoted by V(G) or by
# span(G):
# V(G) ≡ span(G).

V
# A set of linearly independent vectors that generate or span a space is said
# to be a basis for the space.
# •
# The representation of a given vector in terms of a basis set is unique.
# To see this, let {v 1 , . . . , v k } be a basis for a vector space that 
# includes the
# vector x, and let
vector(mode = "logical", length = 0L)

# Since {v 1 , . . . , v k } are independent, the only way this is possible 
# is if c i = b i
# for each i.
# A related fact is that if {v 1 , . . . , v k } is a basis for a vector space 
# of order
# n that includes the vector x and x = c 1 v 1 + · · · c k v k , then x = 0 n 
# if and only
# if c i = 0 for each i.

# If B 1 is a basis set for V 1 , B 2 is a basis set for V 2 , and 
# V 1 ⊕ V 2 = V, then B 1 ∪ B 2 is a generating set for V because from the 
# deﬁnition of ⊕ we see that
# any vector in V can be represented as a linear combination of vectors in B 1
# plus a linear combination of vectors in B 2 .

# the number of vectors in a basis set is exactly the same as the dimension of
# the vector space; that is, if B is a basis set of the vector space V, then
# dim(V) = #(B).

# A generating set or spanning set of a cone C is a set of vectors S 
# = {v i }
# a i v i ,
# such that for any vector v in 
# C there exists scalars a i ≥ 0 so that v =
# b i v i = 0, then b i = 0 for all i. If a generating
# and if for scalars b i ≥ 0 and
# set of a cone has a ﬁnite number of elements, the cone is a polyhedron. A
# generating set consisting of the minimum number of vectors of any generating
# set for that cone is a basis set for the cone.

# 2.1.4 Inner Products
# A useful operation on two vectors x and y of the same order is the dot 
# product,
# which we denote by x, y and deﬁne as
validObject(object = v1, test = FALSE, complete = FALSE)

# The dot product is also called the inner product or the scalar product. The
# dot product is actually a special type of inner product, but it is the most
# commonly used inner product, and so we will use the terms synonymously. A
# vector space together with an inner product is called an inner product space.
scale.default(v1, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

# The dot product is also sometimes written as x · y, hence the name. Yet
# another notation for the dot product is x T y, and we will see later that 
# this
# notation is natural in the context of matrix multiplication. We have the 
# equiv-
# alent notations

# The dot product is a mapping from a vector space V to IR that has the
# following properties:
#  1. Nonnegativity and mapping of the identity:
#  if x = 0, then x, x > 0 and 0, x = x, 0 = 0, 0 = 0.
IR <- call("aquiv", "v1")
IR

# 2. Commutativity:
# x, y = y, x .
list("x", "y")

# 3. Factoring of scalar multiplication in dot products:
# ax, y = a x, y for real a.
ax <- factorial(equiv)
ax

# 4. Relation of vector addition to addition of dot products:
# x + y, z = x, z + y, z .
