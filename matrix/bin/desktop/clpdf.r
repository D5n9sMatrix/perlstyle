# An L p norm is also called a p-norm, or 1-norm, 2-norm, or ∞-norm in those
# special cases.
# It is easy to see that, for any n-vector x, the L p norms have the relation-
#  ships
# (2.12)
# x ∞ ≤ x 2 ≤ x 1 .
q <- 19
pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
q + sin(q)

# More generally, for given x and for p ≥ 1, we see that x p is a nonincreasing
# function of p.
# We also have bounds that involve the number of elements in the vector:
#  √
# (2.13)
# x ∞ ≤ x 2 ≤ nx ∞
p = 16
p > 1
p + sin(p) + c(0:999)

# The triangle inequality obviously holds
# for the L 1 and L ∞ norms. For the

# L 2 norm it can be seen by expanding (x i + y i ) 2 and then using the Cauchy-
#  Schwartz inequality (2.10) on page 16. Rather than approaching it that way,
# however, we will show below that the L 2 norm can be defined in terms of an
# inner product, and then we will establish the triangle inequality for any norm
# defined similarly by an inner product; see inequality (2.19). Showing that the
# triangle inequality holds for other L p norms is more diﬃcult; see Exercise 2
# .6.
# A generalization of the L p vector norm is the weighted L p vector norm
# defined by
trigamma(p)

# Basis Norms
# If {v 1 , . . . , v k } is a basis for a vector space that includes a 
# vector x with
# x = c 1 v 1 + · · · + c k v k , then

# is a norm. It is straightforward to see that ρ(x) is a norm by checking the

p + sin(p)

# ρ(x) ≥ 0 and ρ(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0 because x = 0 if and only if
# c i = 0 for all i.

# If y = b 1 v 1 + · · · + b k v k , then
p <- c(10, 5, 20, 5, 30, 5)
p + sin(p)

# The last inequality is just the triangle inequality for the L 2 norm for the
# vectors (c 1 , · · · , c k ) and (b 1 , · · · , b k )

# In Section 2.2.5, we will consider special forms of basis sets in which the
# norm in equation (2.16) is identically the L 2 norm. (This is called 
# Parseval’s
# identity, equation (2.38).)

# Equivalence of Norms
# There is an equivalence among any two norms over a formed linear space in
# the sense that if  ·  a and  ·  b are norms, then there are positive numbers r
# and s such that for any x in the space,
# r x b ≤ x a ≤ s x b .
p + cos(p)

# Expressions (2.13) and (2.14) are examples of this general equivalence for
# three L p norms.

# We can prove inequality (2.17) by using the norm defined in equal-
# son (2.16). We need only consider the case x = 0, because the inequality
# is obviously true if x = 0. Let  ·  a be any norm over a given formed linear
# space and let {v 1 , . . . , v k } be a basis for the space. Any x in the 
# space has a
# representation in terms of the basis, x = c 1 v 1 + · · · + c k v k . Then
