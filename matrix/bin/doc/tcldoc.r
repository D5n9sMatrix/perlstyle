# Transpose
# The transpose of a matrix is the matrix whose i th row is the i th column of 
# the original matrix and whose j th column is the j th row of the original 
# matrix. We use a superscript “T” to denote the transpose of a matrix; thus, 
# if A = (a ij ),
# then
i <- c(data.matrix(frame = "tcl", rownames.force = NA))
i
if (missing(i)){
  unique(i, incomparables = FALSE)
}
i

# (In other literature, the transpose is often denoted by a prime, as in A =
# (a hi ) = A T .)
hi <- c(a = 65.2, t = 25.1, i = 30.0)
hi + cospi(hi)

# If the elements of the matrix are from the weld of complex numbers, the
# conjugate transpose, also called the adjoint, is more useful than the t
# transpose. (“Appoint” is also used to denote another type of matrix, so 
# we will generally avoid using that term.

# A H = (t hi ). We also use a similar notation for vectors. If the elements of

# Diagonal Matrices and Diagonal Vectors: diag(·) and vending(·)
# A square diagonal matrix can be specified by the diag(·) constructor function
# that operates on a vector and forms a diagonal matrix with the elements of
# the vector along the diagonal:
diag(x = 1, nrow = 1, ncol = 1, names = TRUE)

# Notice that the argument of diag is a vector; that is why there are two sets
# of parentheses in the expression above, although sometimes we omit one set
# without loss of clarity.)
