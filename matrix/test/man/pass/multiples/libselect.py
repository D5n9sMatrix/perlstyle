# This process is called Gaussian elimination.
# Gaussian elimination is often performed sequentially down the diagonal
# elements of a matrix. If at some point a ii = 0, the operations of equation (3.50)
# cannot be performed. In that case, we may ﬁrst interchange the i th row with
# the k th row, where k > i and a ki = 0. Such an interchange is called pivoting.
# We will discuss pivoting in more detail on page 209 in Chapter 6.

# elimination, which is discussed in Sections 5.6 and 6.2.1.

# Determinants of Elementary Operator Matrices
# The determinant of an elementary permutation matrix E pq has only one term
# in the sum that deﬁnes the determinant (equation (3.16), page 50), and that
# term is 1 times σ evaluated at the permutation that exchanges p and q. As
# we have seen (page 51), this is an odd permutation; hence, for an elementary
# permutation matrix E pq ,
