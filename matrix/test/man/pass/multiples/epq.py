# interchanged. An elementary permutation matrix, which is the identity with
# the p th and q th rows interchanged, is denoted by E pq . That is, E pq is the
# th row is e T identity, except the p th row is e T q and the q p . Note that E 
# pq E qp . Thus, for example, if the given matrix is 4 m, to interchange the 
# second and third rows, we use
