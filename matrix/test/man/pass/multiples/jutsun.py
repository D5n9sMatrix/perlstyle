# Often, numerical computations with matrices are more accurate if the rows

# be performed by premultiplication by an elementary transformation matrix.

# matrix, which is denoted by E p (a), is the identity matrix in which the p th
# diagonal element has been replaced by a. Thus, for example, if the given
# matrix is 4 × m, to multiply the second row by a, we use
