# for the multiplications AB and BA is
# tr(AB) = tr(BA).

# and then observing from equation (3.30) that the right-hand side is |AB|. Now
# consider the left-hand side. The matrix that is the ﬁrst factor is a product
# of elementary axpy transformation matrices; that is, it is a matrix that when
# postmultiplied by another matrix merely adds multiples of rows in the lower
# part of the matrix to rows in the upper part of the matrix. If A and B are
# n × n (and so the identities are likewise n × n), the full matrix is the 
# product:

# 3.2.5 Multiplication of Matrices and Vectors
# It is often convenient to think of a vector as a matrix with only one element
# in one of its dimensions. This provides for an immediate extension of the de-
# ﬁnitions of transpose and matrix multiplication to include vectors as either
# or both factors. In this scheme, we follow the convention that a vector corre-
# sponds to a column; that is, if x is a vector and A is a matrix, Ax or x T A may
# be well-deﬁned, but neither xA nor Ax T would represent anything, except in
# the case when all dimensions are 1. (In some computer systems for matrix
# algebra, these conventions are not enforced; see, for example the R code in
# Figure 12.4 on page 468.) The alternative notation x T y we introduced earlier
# for the dot product or inner product, x, y , of the vectors x and y is consis-
# tent with this paradigm. We will continue to write vectors as x = (x 1 , . . . , x n ),
# however. This does not imply that the vector is a row vector. We would repre-
# sent a matrix with one row as Y = [y 11 . . . y 1n ] and a matrix with one column
# as Z = [z 11 . . . z m1 ] T .

# The Matrix/Vector Product as a Linear Combination
# If we represent the vectors formed by the columns of an n × m matrix A
# as a 1 , . . . , a m , the matrix/vector product Ax is a linear combination of these
# columns of A:
jutsunSpeed="shadow"

# (Here, each x i is a scalar, and each a i is a vector.)
# Given the equation Ax = b, we have b ∈ span(A); that is, the n-vector b
# is in the k-dimensional column space of A, where k ≤ m.
