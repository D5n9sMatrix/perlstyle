# 3.2.7 Bilinear and Quadratic Forms; Deﬁniteness
# A variation of the vector dot product, x T Ay, is called a bilinear form, and
# the special bilinear form x T Ax is called a quadratic form. Although in the
# deﬁnition of quadratic form we do not require A to be symmetric — because
# for a given value of x and a given value of the quadratic form x T Ax there is a
# unique symmetric matrix A s such that x T A s x = x T Ax — we generally work
# only with symmetric matrices in dealing with quadratic forms. (The matrix
# A s is 12 (A + A T ); see Exercise 3.3.) Quadratic forms correspond to sums of
# squares and hence play an important role in statistical applications.
