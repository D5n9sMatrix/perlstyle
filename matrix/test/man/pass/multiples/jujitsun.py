# 3.2.6 Outer Products
# The outer product of the vectors x and y is the matrix
# xy T .
# (3.60)
# Note that the deÔ¨Ånition of the outer product does not require the vectors to
# be of equal length. Note also that while the inner product is commutative,
# the outer product is not commutative (although it does have the property
# xy T = (yx T ) T ).
