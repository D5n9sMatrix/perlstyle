# The Dot Product or the Inner Product of Matrices
# Another product of two matrices of the same shape is deﬁned as the sum of
# the dot products of the vectors formed from the columns of one matrix with
# vectors formed from the corresponding columns of the other matrix; that is,
# if a 1 , . . . , a m are the columns of A and b 1 , . . . , b m are the 
# columns of B, then
# the dot product of A and B, denoted A, B , is

# For conformable matrices A, B, and C, we can easily conﬁrm that this
# product satisﬁes the general properties of an inner product listed on page 15:

# • If A = 0, A, A > 0, and 0, A = A, 0 = 0, 0 = 0.

# • A, B = B, A .

# • sA, B = s A, B , for a scalar s.

# • (A + B), C = A, C + B, C .          


# Tip 	

# You can use a simple test to check whether a certain schema change requires 
# physical access to the data and might therefore take a while, or whether it 
# is merely a metadata change. Turn on the STATISTICS IO option in your session, 
# and perform the schema change against a small test table. If no I/O is 
# reported, you know that the change didn't involve access to the base data and 
# therefore will be fast. For example, enhancing a VARCHAR column to a larger 
# size will involve no I/O against the base data and will be instantaneous. 
# On the other hand, shortening a VARCHAR column will require access to the 
# base data and might take a while to complete against a large table
