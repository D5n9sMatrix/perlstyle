# Rather than diÔ¨Äerences in scales being just in the directions of the co-
# ordinate axes, more generally we may think of anisometries being measured
# by general (but perhaps symmetric) matrices. (The covariance and correlation
# matrices deÔ¨Åned on page 294 come to mind. Any such matrix to be used in this
# context should be positive deÔ¨Ånite because we will generalize the dot prod-
# uct, which is necessarily nonnegative, in terms of a quadratic form.) A bilinear
# form x T Ay may correspond more closely to the properties of the application
# than the standard inner product.
