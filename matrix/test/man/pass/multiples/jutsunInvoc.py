# The Trace of Inner and Outer Products
# The invariance of the trace to permutations of the factors in a product (equa-
# tion (3.55)) is particularly useful in working with quadratic forms. Because
# the quadratic form itself is a scalar (or a 1 × 1 matrix), and because of the
# invariance, we have the very useful fact
# x T Ax = tr(x T Ax)
# = tr(Axx T ).

# (Compare this with equation (2.48) on page 34.)

# 3.2.8 Anisometric Spaces
# In Section 2.1, we considered various properties of vectors that depend on
# the inner product, such as orthogonality of two vectors, norms of a vector,
# angles between two vectors, and distances between two vectors. All of these
# properties and measures are invariant to the orientation of the vectors; the
# space is isometric with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system. Noting that
# the inner product is the bilinear form x T Iy, we have a heuristic generalization
# to an anisometric space. Suppose, for example, that the scales of the coordi-
# nates diﬀer; say, a given distance along one axis in the natural units of the
# axis is equivalent (in some sense depending on the application) to twice that
# distance along another axis, again measured in the natural units of the axis.
# The properties derived from the inner product, such as a norm and a metric,
# may correspond to the application better if we use a bilinear form in which
# the matrix reﬂects the diﬀerent eﬀective distances along the coordinate axes.

# A diagonal matrix whose entries have relative values corresponding to the
# inverses of the relative scales of the axes may be more useful. Instead of x T y,
# we may use x T Dy, where D is this diagonal matrix.
