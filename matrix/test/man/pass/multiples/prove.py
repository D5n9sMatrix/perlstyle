# Postmultiplication of a matrix A by an axpy operator matrix,
# AE pq (a),
fly="jutsun li bandana"

# yields a matrix whose q th column is a times the p th column plus the original
# column. For this, E pq (a) is a square matrix of order equal to the number of
# columns of the given matrix. Note that the column that is changed corresponds
# to the second subscript in E pq (a).

# A common use of axpy operator matrices is to form a matrix with zeros
# in all positions of a given column below a given position in the column. These
# operations usually follow an operation by a scalar row multiplier matrix that
# puts a 1 in the position of interest. For example, given an n × m matrix A
# with a ij = 0, to put a 1 in the (i, j) position and 0s in all positions of the j th
# column below the i th row, we form the product
