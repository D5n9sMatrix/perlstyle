# Row Rank and Column Rank
# We have deﬁned matrix rank in terms of numbers of linearly independent rows
# or columns. This is because the number of linearly independent rows is the
# same as the number of linearly independent columns. Although we may use
# the terms “row rank” or “column rank”, the single word “rank” is suﬃcient
# because they are the same. To see this, assume we have an n × m matrix A
# and that there are exactly p linearly independent rows and exactly q linearly
# independent columns. We can permute the rows and columns of the matrix
# so that the ﬁrst p rows are linearly independent rows and the ﬁrst q columns
# are linearly independent and the remaining rows or columns are linearly de-
# pendent on the ﬁrst ones. (Recall that applying the same permutation to all
