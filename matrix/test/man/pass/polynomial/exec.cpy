# Interchange of Rows or Columns; Permutation Matrices
# By ﬁrst interchanging the rows or columns of a matrix, it may be possible
# to partition the matrix in such a way that the partitions have interesting
# or desirable properties. Also, in the course of performing computations on a
# matrix, it is often desirable to interchange the rows or columns of the matrix.
# (This is an instance of “pivoting”, which will be discussed later, especially
# in Chapter 6.) In matrix computations, we almost never actually move data
# from one row or column to another; rather, the interchanges are eﬀected by
# changing the indexes to the data.
